# Overview
This is a simple maze game to show off what I have learned in class. I wanted to make a maze game as a callback to my first game I made in scratch which is also a maze game. I wanted the maze layout to be easily configurable which is why it uses tile maps. Initially I wanted to do a maze game with multiple levels and sprites but because of me not wanting to feature creep, over complicated things and time constraints I decided to scale back the scope and just make a simple maze game. I also used a tutorial on how to make an RPG but because I wanted to make it my own I used the tutorial as a foundation and made it a maze game.
